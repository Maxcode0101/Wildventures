<div class="faq-container" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    
    <h2>1. I’m brand-new to campervans and have tons of questions. How can I learn more?</h2>
    <p>
        Don’t worry—you’re in good hands! We love talking with our customers and sharing
        all the tips and tricks you need for a smooth trip. Once you book, we’ll send you
        a helpful guide on great places to visit and practical logistics to keep your road
        trip stress-free. If you need anything else, just get in touch; we’re here to help.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What’s the minimum rental period?</h2>
    <p>
        We don’t have one. Book for as many (or as few) days as you like.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How do I find scenic or unique spots to park overnight?</h2>
    <p>
        We recommend sites and apps like Park4Night, HomeCamper, and CampSpace. They help
        you discover unique natural hideaways that make your campervan adventure truly
        special. We’re always exploring them ourselves and will share our favorite curated
        spots so you can make the most of your trip!
    </p>

    <h2>4. Is wild camping allowed?</h2>
    <p>
        There’s no single rule for wild camping. Regulations differ by region and can even
        vary from town to town. If you’re unsure, let us know and we’ll do our best to
        advise you.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Are all your campers insured?</h2>
    <p>
        Absolutely. Each camper comes with third-party liability, glass coverage, and 24/7
        roadside assistance. That covers third-party property damage, and we also include
        full coverage with a zero-euro deductible for damage on the camper itself.
    </p>

    <h2>6. What driver’s license do I need?</h2>
    <p>
        A regular Category B license is fine for all our campervans.
    </p>

    <h2>7. What are your check-in and check-out times?</h2>
    <p>
        Standard check-in starts at 3:30 p.m., and check-out is at 10 a.m. We’re flexible
        if we have availability—just ask us. You can also arrive any time or day at no
        extra charge.
    </p>

    <h2>8. What’s your cancellation policy?</h2>
    <p>
        - If you cancel at least 30 days before pickup, you’ll be refunded everything you’ve paid so far.<br>
        - Cancel 15–30 days before check-in, and you can choose between a 50% refund or a flexible travel voucher for 100% of the amount (valid for one year).<br>
        - Cancel less than 15 days before, and you’ll receive a voucher worth 40% of the total booking.<br><br>
        <em>
            *The voucher is valid for one year (low season only: Nov 1–Apr 30, excluding holiday periods).
            If the cancellation is initiated by you, you’ll cover any payment fees or charges.
        </em>
    </p>

    <h2>9. Do you charge extra if more than two people travel?</h2>
    <p>
        Not at all. The price is per vehicle, not per person.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Is there a cleaning fee?</h2>
    <p>
        No. It’s included in the rental price.
    </p>

    <h2>11. How much is the security deposit?</h2>
    <p>
        The deposit is €750. You can pay in cash when you pick up the camper or via
        bank transfer beforehand.
    </p>

    <h2>12. When do I get the security deposit back?</h2>
    <p>
        Right after you’ve returned the camper on time, with no damages, and in accordance
        with our return guidelines.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Are there any penalties I should know about?</h2>
    <p>
        - Late handover/checkout: More than 30 minutes late means a €20 fee for every
          30-minute increment.<br>
        - Returning the camper damaged: €50 handling fee; your deposit is held until we
          have repair cost estimates.<br>
        - Wastewater not emptied/freshwater empty at return: €10 fee<br>
        - Toilet cassette not cleaned: €80 fee
    </p>
