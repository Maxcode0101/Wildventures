Wildventures represents a campervan rental business. The intention is to target adventure seekers and outdoorlovers who are into camping and roadtrips. The web based booking application allows users to gather informations about the available campervans, create an account, create a booking, and then manage, edit or delete their bookings. This site was developed using Python (Django), HTML, CSS and stores data in a PostgreSQL database.



Don't add screenshots for the README/TESTING into your `assets` or `static` folders. Create a new folder at the root-level called `documentation`. Consider creating sub-directories within `documentation` to handle things like `wireframes`, `features`, `validation`, `responsiveness`, etc.

**Site Mockups**
*([amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://campervan-rental-923a0b226ad3.herokuapp.com), [techsini](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup), etc.)*
Having issues generating site mockups? This is likely due to security policies with your deployed site.
If you open up your DevTools, there may be an error referencing `X-Frame-Options`.

For Chrome users, head over to http://bit.ly/3iRPn4u and install the extension within your browser. Once installed, navigate back to the mockup site of your choice. You should find your site rendering in the various devices now.

Alternatively, open your project in Gitpod and run the server. Once the site is running, click the `Ports` tab from your Gitpod Terminal. Click the padlock on the appropriate port for your project (`Flask: 5000`, `Django: 8000`). This will make your local page public temporarily. Now, copy the URL of your live-preview page into the responsive tool above. You should find your site rendering in the various devices.

## UX

### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy Plane
##### Purpose
- Provide blog owners with tools to create, manage, and moderate engaging blog content and user interactions.
- Offer users and guests an intuitive platform to explore, engage, and contribute to blog discussions.

##### Primary User Needs
- Travellers need a reliable campervan that fits their needs (for instance, 4x4 drive, certain capacity etc.)
- Registered users need the ability to create, update, manage and delete a booking.
- Guests need the ability to browse and filter different campervans, gather information about the business and the rental conditions, and contact the service team.

##### Business Goals
- Rent out campervans for profit
- Give users the possibility to easily find a vehicle that fits their needs by dynamic filtering
- Make sure that users are having easy access to all of the informations regarding the rental process
- Providing a easy to handle booking management system

#### 2. Scope Plane
##### Features
- A full list of [Features](#features) can be viewed in detail below.

##### Content Requirements
- Booking management system (create, update, delete, and preview).
- Comment moderation and management tools.
- User account features (register, log in, log out, change Email/Password).
- Notification system for booking/payment and change- or cancel booking confirmations.
- 404 error page for lost users.

#### 3. Structure Plane
##### Information Architecture

  - Links to Home/About Us, Contact Page, FAQ's, Our Campervans, User Dashboard, Manage my Bookings, User Profile, Login/Register
  
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Campervan list displayed prominently for easy browsing.
  - Clear call-to-action buttons for all functionalities regarding account- and booking management.

##### User Flow
1. Guest users browse and filter campervans.
2. Guest users register for an account → sign up / log in to create a reservation. → Receive a approval notification.
3. Registered users can change dates or cancel their pending booking (reservation) → receive a approval notification.
4. Registered users pay for their reservation → receive a approval notification.
5. Registered users request a date change or cancelation of their aproved booking → receive a approval or notification.

#### 4. Skeleton Plane
##### Wireframe Suggestions
- A full list of [Wireframes](#wireframes) can be viewed in detail below.

#### 5. Surface Plane
##### Visual Design Elements
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)**: see below.
- **[Typography](#typography)**: see below.

### Colour Scheme

⚠️INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Explain your colors and color scheme. Consider adding a link and screenshot for your color scheme using [coolors](https://coolors.co/generate).

When you add a color to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your color palette later if needed. See example below:

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/080708-3772ff-df2935-fdca40-e6e8e6) to generate my color palette.

- `#000000` primary text.
- `#3772FF` primary highlights.
- `#DF2935` secondary text.
- `#FDCA40` secondary highlights.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

### Typography

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like **Google Fonts**, **Font Awesome**, etc. Consider adding a link to each font used, the Font Awesome site (if used), or similar icon library.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

### Agile Methodology

This project was developed using the Agile methodology. All user stories implementation progress was tracked through Github projects Kanban Board which can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Maxcode0101/projects/5). The MoSCoW method has been used to prioritize the project steps.

![KanbanBoard](documentation/readme/KanbanPP4.webp)

| Target | Expectation | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| As a prospective customer | I want to register for an account and log in | So that I can manage my bookings and receive notifications. |
| As a customer | I want to view a list of available campervans and filter them by brand, model, capacity, price, and availability dates | So that I can easily find a vehicle that meets my needs. |
| As a customer | I want to select a campervan and book it for a specific date range (with a minimum of 4 days from today) | So that I can reserve the vehicle for my trip. |
| As a customer | I want to view all my bookings in a dashboard | So that I can track their status (Pending, Confirmed, Ongoing, Past) and manage them. |
| As a customer | I want to update the dates for my pending booking via self-service | So that I can adjust my reservation if needed before payment. |
| As a customer | I want to request a date change for a confirmed booking | So that I can propose changes that require admin approval. |
| As a customer | I want to cancel a booking (only if it’s pending and in the future) | So that I can change my plans if necessary. |
| As an admin | I want to review and manage cancellation and date change requests | So that I can approve or reject them according to business rules. |
| As a user | I want a visually appealing and responsive website | So that my experience is seamless whether on mobile or desktop. |
| As a business owner | I want that reservations that are not getting paid by the customer within 3 days are automatically getting cancelled | so that the admin or staff doesn't have to manually cancel the unpaid reservations. |
| As a customer | I want to read customer reviews of past guests | so that I can have an impression of the quality of the offered campervans and service. |

## Wireframes

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

If you've created wireframes or mock-ups, use this section to display screenshots of your wireframes. The example table below uses sample pages from the walkthrough project to give you some inspiration for your own project, so please adjust accordingly.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

![screenshot](documentation/erd.png)

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Using your defined models, create an ERD with the relationships identified. A couple of recommendations for building your own free ERDs:
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning)
- [Draw.io](https://draw.io)

Looking for an interactive version of your ERD? Consider using a [`Mermaid flowchart`](https://mermaid.live). To simplify the process, you can ask ChatGPT (or similar) the following prompt:

> ChatGPT Prompt:
> "Generate a Markdown syntax Mermaid ERD using my Django models"
> [paste-your-django-models-into-ChatGPT]

The "I Think Therefore I Blog" sample ERD in Markdown syntax using Mermaid can be seen below as an example.

**NOTE**: A Markdown Preview tool doesn't show the interactive ERD; you must first commit/push the code to your GitHub repository in order to see it live in action.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I have used `Mermaid` to generate an interactive ERD of my project.

⚠️ RECOMMENDED ⚠️

Alternatively, or in addition to, a more comprehensive ERD can be auto-generated once you're at the end of your development stages, just before you submit. Follow the steps below to obtain a thorough ERD that you can include. Feel free to leave the steps below in the README for future use to yourself.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- drag the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

⚠️ TIP ⚠️

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental)](https://www.github.com/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental/issues) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png) |
| [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental)](https://www.github.com/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png) |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCow" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://campervan-rental-923a0b226ad3.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user-inserts-own-cloudinary-url |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | any-random-secret-key |

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- *Optional*: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
    - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
    - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
    - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django’s "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user-inserts-own-cloudinary-url")  # only if using Cloudinary

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `⌘+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental).
2. Locate and click on the green "Code" button at the very top, above the commits and files.
3. Select whether you prefer to clone using "HTTPS", "SSH", or "GitHub CLI", and click the "copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open "Git Bash" or "Terminal".
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone the repository:
	- `git clone https://www.github.com/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental.git`
7. Press "Enter" to create your local clone.

**Please Note**: in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you should have the browser extension installed. A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository. You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com/Maxcode0101/campervan_rental).
2. At the top of the Repository, just below the "Settings" button on the menu, locate and click the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.
